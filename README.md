Basic Relationships in an Ellipse
Where as a radius will is longer and smaller. the longer is called a=semi-major axis and the smaller is called b=semi-minor axis.

The eccentricity is defined as:

𝑒𝑐
  = c/a =  𝑎2−𝑏2√𝑎
 
The ellipticity is defined as:

𝑒𝑝
  =  𝑎−𝑏𝑎
 

In 1601, johannes Kepler acquired the extensive, meticulous observations of the planets. he published the first two law in 1609 of his three laws of planetary motion. The first law states:"The orbit of every planet is an ellipse with the sun at a focus." Generally, the path of an object unergoing keplerian motion can follow a parabola or a hyperbola, which is a long with ellipses, belong to a group of curves known as conic sections.

Hyperbolic trajectory(e > 1)

Parabolic trajectory(e = 1)

elliptical orbit(0 < e < 1)

Circular orbit(e = 0)

In celestial mechanics, a Keplerian Orbitdescribes the mmotion of an orbiting body as an ellipse, parbola, or hyperbola, which forms a two-demensional orbital plan in three-dimensional space. A keplerian orbit can also form a straight line. it considers only the point like gravitational attraction of two bodies, neglecting perturbations.
The distance between a central body and an orbiting body can be expressed as:

r(v) =  𝑎(1−𝑒2)1+𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝑣)
 
r =the distance, a=the semi-major axis, which defines the size of the orbit, e=the eccentricity, which defines the shape of the orbit, v = the true anomaly, which is the angle between the current position of the orbiting object and the location in the orbit at which it is closest to the central body(the perigee)
